The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, you might expect the `.parent .child` selector to override the `color: red !important` declaration due to its higher specificity. However, the `!important` flag takes precedence, resulting in the text remaining red.

The uncommon aspect is the subtle interplay between inheritance, specificity, and the `!important` flag.  Many developers assume that higher specificity always wins, even against `!important`, which is incorrect.
