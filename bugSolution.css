To resolve this issue, avoid using the `!important` flag whenever possible.  The best approach is to refactor your CSS to achieve the desired styling without resorting to `!important`.  If absolutely necessary to use `!important`, ensure you thoroughly understand its implications.

A better solution is to restructure your CSS using a more appropriate specificity hierarchy:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

Now, `.parent .child` correctly overrides the `color: red` applied to `.child`, producing the expected green color.  This illustrates how proper CSS structuring is far preferable to using `!important`.
